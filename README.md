## Overview

Webgen enables users to create custom, responsive websites by simply describing what they want. By integrating with Google Gemini’s advanced language model, Webgen interprets your intent and produces ready-to-use code, saving time and reducing manual effort.

---

## Motivation

Building websites from scratch can be time-consuming, especially for those who want to focus on ideas rather than implementation details. Webgen aims to lower the barrier for web creation by translating your ideas directly into functional web apps, making web development accessible to everyone.

---

## Features

- **Prompt-to-Website**: Transform natural language prompts into complete websites.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Powered by Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes Google Gemini for intelligent generation of code and content.
- **Customizable Output**: Easily tailor the generated site to your needs.
- **Instant Preview**: Live development server for real-time feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: All generated sites are mobile-friendly by default.
